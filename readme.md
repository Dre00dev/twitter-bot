# Motivational / Tech Twitter Bot

Created a python program that will request a quote from zenquotes api and post it or retweet another person's tech related tweet.
Keywords and duration can be adjusted.  
I hosted @Comp_Sci_bot on railways simply because tthe process was simpler and they have a lot of credit hours for free.
Heres an example of a tweet that @Comp_Sci_bot posted

# Goals
# Create a bot that will post motivational quotes and retweet content related to Tech throughout the day

---Hosting Options---
 - Replit free & complex and requires you to ping or request the web server within an hour or it will sleep. 
 - Heroku no longer free
 - Railway Seems much simpler 500 hours of uptime per month or equivalent to rougly 20 days.  

 To Do:
 - ‚úÖCreate a function to request a random quote from zenquotes api
 - ‚úÖcreate another function to post this quote every hour or 1-3 hours 
 - ‚úÖCreate a function to search for tech or coding related tweets 
 - ‚úÖCreate another function to post this quote every hour or 1-3 hours.  
 - ‚úÖRequirements for these functions is that they do not run unless the other was the last posted.  
 - ‚úÖFor example, if the last post was a retweet then post a quote, if the last post was "original" tweet then post a retweet.
