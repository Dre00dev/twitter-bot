# Goals
# Create a bot that will post motivational quotes and retweet content related to Tech throughout the day
# Goal is to create a project that fully automated and won't need to be run locally


---Hosting Options---

 - Replit free & complex and requires you to ping or request the web server within an hour or it will sleep. 
 - Heroku no longer free
 - Railway Seems much simpler 500 hours of uptime per month or equivalent to rougly 20 days.  

 To Do:
 - ✅Create a function to request a random quote from zenquotes api
 - ✅create another function to post this quote every hour or 1-3 hours 
 - ✅Create a function to search for tech or coding related tweets 
 - ✅Create another function to post this quote every hour or 1-3 hours.  
 - ✅Requirements for these functions is that they do not run unless the other was the last posted.  
 - ✅For example, if the last post was a retweet then post a quote, if the last post was "original" tweet then post a retweet.
