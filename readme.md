<h1 align="center">Motivational / Tech Twitter Bot</h1>

- Created a python program that will request a quote from zenquotes api and post it or retweet another person's tech related tweet.
- Keywords and duration can be adjusted.
- I hosted @Comp_Sci_bot on railways simply because the process was simpler and they have a lot of credit hours for free.

Here's an example of a tweet that @Comp_Sci_bot posted:

This is a thread of it running throughout the day:

## Goals

Create a bot that will post motivational quotes and retweet content related to Tech throughout the day.

### Hosting Options

- Replit: free & complex and requires you to ping or request the web server within an hour or it will sleep.
- Heroku: no longer free
- Railway: Seems much simpler. 500 hours of uptime per month or equivalent to roughly 20 days.

### To Do

- ‚úÖ Create a function to request a random quote from zenquotes api
- ‚úÖ Create another function to post this quote every hour or 1-3 hours
- ‚úÖ Create a function to search for tech or coding related tweets
- ‚úÖ Create another function to post this quote every hour or 1-3 hours.
- ‚úÖ Requirements for these functions is that they do not run unless the other was the last posted.
- ‚úÖ For example, if the last post was a retweet then post a quote, if the last post was "original" tweet then post a retweet.

Completed version: üòÖ Just change your private keys and tokens for your own. üòÅ
